      <h2>Listen Up...</h2>
      <p>I lived throughout most of my life on the computer ever since I was a kid. There were goals I've had during my previous time in which were unrelated to computer science. However, I realized that they were uninteresting to me and they only have the money factor remaining as a positive in my eyes. From now on, I've dedicated my life towards my computer and want to have a career that revolves around using one. I hope to succeed along with my peers in the future as full stack web developers.</p>
